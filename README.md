# Idle Clicker Game


I wrote a basic [react.js](https://reactjs.org/) based idle clicker game with a shop and inventory, and a clicking button. Inspired by games such as [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) and [Paperclips](http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/). 

The project was created as a static SPA using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
